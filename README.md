# Music hit prediction and recommenders project

I authored two Jupyter notebooks for <a href='https://www.inspiritai.com/'>Inspirit AI</a>'s AI Scholars program for high schoolers. The two notebooks (numbered 3 and 4) do the following:

1. Notebook 3 takes a dataset of songs on Spotify, labelled according to whether they were a hit or not, and uses the first minute of audio from each song (represented in terms of the <a href='https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-analysis'>12 timbre components</a> sampled every 500 milliseconds) to predict this label. The notebooks use several supervised learning classifiers, including logistic regression, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbours, Naive Bayes classifier, a multilayer perceptron and a recurrent neural network with LSTM cells.
2. Notebook 4 is a bonus notebook that discusses how Spotify's timbre components were derived, and teaches the students how Principal Components Analysis works.

While I am unable to share the notebooks publicly, please <a href="mailto:aditya.chander@yale.edu">get in touch with me via email</a> if you want to find out more about these notebooks. 

I am also working on the problem of hit song prediction and music recommendation beyond the scope of the Inspirit AI curriculum.
